- **Weather Data**: Daily climate data for the same period.

### Columns in Bike Rental Data:
- `Ride ID`: Unique identifier for each ride.
- `Rideable Type`: Type of bike used.
- `Started At`: Start date and time of the ride.
- `Ended At`: End date and time of the ride.
- `Start Station Name`: Name of the start station.
- `Start Station ID`: Unique identifier for start station.
- `End Station Name`: Name of the end station.
- `End Station ID`: Unique identifier for end station.
- `Start Latitude`: Latitude of the start location.
- `Start Longitude`: Longitude of the start location.
- `End Latitude`: Latitude of the end location.
- `End Longitude`: Longitude of the end location.
- `Member or Casual`: Type of rider.

### Columns in Weather Data:
- `Date`: Date.
- `PRCP`: Precipitation value for the day.
- `SNOW`: Snowfall.
- `TMAX`: Maximum temperature of the day.
- `TMIN`: Minimum temperature of the day.

## Data Preprocessing
